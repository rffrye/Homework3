Random password generator

Description: Online application to randomly generate a password based on criteria that the user provides when prompted.

When the user clicks the button "Generate Password," first they will be promoted to enter a password length. If the length is outside the range of 8-128 characters, the user is prompted to once again enter a password length within the range. The prompt will loop until the user enters a valid number.

The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, special charaters, uppercase and/or lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.  The application will follow any combination of the four character categories as long as at least one is chosen.

When all parameters have been defined, the password will appear within the password box.

HTML, CSS, and some JS was provided to get the project started.
